## NGS-Analysis-in-R
Sequence Analysis in R and Bioconductor.

## R Base

Some basic string handling utilities. Wide spectrum of numeric data analysis tools.

## Bioconductor

Bioconductor packages provide much more sophisticated string handling utilities for sequence analysis (Lawrence et al. 2013; Huber et al. 2015).

* Biostrings: general sequence analysis environment
* ShortRead: pipeline for short read data
* IRanges: low-level infrastructure for range data
* GenomicRanges: high-level infrastructure for range data
* GenomicFeatures: managing transcript centric annotations
* GenomicAlignments: handling short genomic alignments
* Rsamtools: interface to samtools, bcftools and tabix
* BSgenome: genome annotation data
* biomaRt: interface to BioMart annotations
* rtracklayer: Annotation imports, interface to online genome browsers
* HelloRanges: Bedtools semantics in Bioc’s Ranges infrastructure
* http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/HelloRanges.html : Bedtools semantics in Bioc’s Ranges infrastructure
